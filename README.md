# Title: 
Welcome to RECS#!T and say goodbye to your weekend planning!

# Overview:
We've all had days where we finally get to enjoy our weekend, ready to get away from work environment and live our life. Except there's that one small roadblock. What the S#!T(TM) do I even do?!? RECS#!T is here to solve that issue you may(or definetly) have! We've been in those positions before and want to try to help in our local area. RECS#!T is a San Diego based app where everybody can post their fun after-work activites. It can be something simple like a hiking trail in the hills, or getting some drinks in the Gaslamp area. This app was proudly made by people who all at one point lived in the San Diego area, and want to try to introduce new activities to new people!

# Features:
Our app is more orientated to doing activities related to being outdoors, or having to leave your home to go somewhere. With that in mind we intergrated a weather API to help you get a quick look at the San Diego weather in real time, along with a Google Maps API(Currently not working) which would assist you in finding the address of any event you want to attend. Our app can be summerize into a psuedo social networking app, but we really wanted to encourage people to post about events they genuinely care about.

# Dependencies:
Our App made use of many Gem and Yarn downloads, so if you wish to download this app to your local, you'll need to be sure to a $bundle and $yarn when you get the app downloaded. The weather api that we implenmented doesn't require a key since it was a free resources, so no worries there!
